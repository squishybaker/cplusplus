// The #include directive tells the compiler where to find
//   input(keyboard) and output(screen) information.
// Words with special meaning, like "#include" and "using" and "int" are
//   called keywords or reserved words.  They usually are given a color
//   in an IDE or Integrated Development Environment like VisualStudio.
#include <iostream>
// "using namespace std" tells the compiler to use the standard names
// so you don't have to say std::cout
using namespace std;
// The start of the program is a function or group of code called 'main'
// It returns an integer so it starts with 'int'
int main()
// Braces identify the start and the end of the function.

    // To the character-based output (screen) send the text "Hello, World.\n"
        cout << "Hello, World.\n";

        system("pause");
    // Exit the program, returning a 0 which means no errors.
